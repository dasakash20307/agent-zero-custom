Task Title: Design Windows Vision and Control System Architecture
Description: Architect the Windows 11 integration system. This includes defining components for screen casting, desktop management, application launching, visual recognition, and automated control mechanisms.
Dependency Analysis: None
Implementation Steps:
1. Research existing technologies and libraries for Windows screen casting, UI automation, and visual recognition (e.g., PyAutoGUI, OpenCV, Windows API).
2. Define the overall system architecture, including modules for vision (screen analysis), control (input simulation), and management (task execution).
3. Specify communication protocols between different components of the system.
4. Design data structures for representing UI elements, application states, and automation scripts.
5. Outline error handling and recovery mechanisms.
Acceptance Criteria:
- A comprehensive architecture document for the Windows Vision and Control System is produced.
- The document details all major components, their interactions, and data flows.
- Potential technologies and libraries are identified.
Testing Requirements:
- Review the architecture design with team members for feasibility, scalability, and robustness.
- Create sequence diagrams for key interaction scenarios.
Technical Considerations:
- Performance implications of screen casting and real-time visual analysis.
- Security considerations for desktop control and application interaction.
- Compatibility with different Windows 11 versions and configurations.
Estimated Completion Time: 12 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Chosen technologies are not suitable or have significant limitations.
- Mitigation: Create small proof-of-concept prototypes for key technologies before full commitment.
- Risk: Architecture is too complex to implement or maintain.
- Mitigation: Prioritize a modular design; start with core functionality and iterate.
