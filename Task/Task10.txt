Task Title: Implement Multi-User UI and Tunnel Configuration
Description: Develop the UI components for the multi-user login screen and the dedicated multi-user chat section. Implement separate tunnel configurations for regular users with persistent, custom domain integration, while maintaining administrative control through the main panel.
Dependency Analysis: Task9.txt
Implementation Steps:
1. Design and implement the UI for the user login screen.
2. Design and implement the UI for the multi-user chat section, ensuring it is distinct from the main chat but can access shared knowledge.
3. Integrate the UI with the backend authentication and profile management APIs developed in Task 9.
4. Develop functionality to manage separate tunnel configurations for users (e.g., assigning custom domains or subdomains).
5. Ensure the main administrative panel retains control over user management and overall system settings.
6. Implement UI elements for users to manage their profile settings.
7. Design and implement permission-based UI elements (e.g., some features visible only to certain user roles).
Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can log in through the new UI.
- A separate multi-user chat section is functional and isolates user sessions.
- User profiles can be viewed and modified through the UI (as per design).
- Admins can manage users and tunnel configurations through the main panel.
- Persistent custom domain integration for user tunnels is functional.
Testing Requirements:
- Test the login UI with various scenarios (correct credentials, incorrect credentials, etc.).
- Test chat session separation thoroughly (e.g., messages in one user's session do not appear in another's).
- Test profile management UI.
- Verify admin panel functionality for user and tunnel management.
- Test custom domain tunnel access for regular users.
Technical Considerations:
- Frontend framework/library choice for UI development.
- Real-time communication for the multi-user chat section (if applicable, e.g., WebSockets).
- Secure handling of API tokens or session cookies in the frontend.
- Integration with existing tunnel management systems or APIs.
Estimated Completion Time: 18 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: UI is not intuitive or user-friendly.
- Mitigation: Conduct usability testing; gather user feedback early in the UI development process.
- Risk: Complexity in managing separate tunnel configurations securely and reliably.
- Mitigation: Thoroughly test tunnel creation, assignment, and access. Automate configuration where possible.
- Risk: Conflicts between the new multi-user UI and the existing main chat window.
- Mitigation: Carefully plan the integration and test interactions between the two interfaces.
