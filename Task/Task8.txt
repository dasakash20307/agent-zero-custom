Task Title: Design Multi-User Authentication and Profile System
Description: Plan the architecture for a robust login system with User ID/password authentication, individual user profiles, separated chat sessions, and permission controls. The system must maintain shared knowledge bases while ensuring user isolation.
Dependency Analysis: None
Implementation Steps:
1. Define user data models (e.g., user ID, hashed password, profile information, associated chat session IDs).
2. Design the authentication flow (login, logout, session management).
3. Specify how user profiles will be structured and stored.
4. Outline mechanisms for chat session separation and data isolation between users.
5. Define how shared knowledge bases will be accessed while respecting user permissions.
6. Plan the integration with the existing main chat window and the new multi-user chat section.
7. Design permission control mechanisms (e.g., roles, access levels).
Acceptance Criteria:
- A detailed design document for the multi-user authentication and profile system is created.
- The document covers data models, authentication flow, profile management, session separation, and permission controls.
- Integration points with existing systems are clearly defined.
Testing Requirements:
- Review the design for security vulnerabilities (e.g., password storage, session hijacking).
- Ensure the design supports scalability for a reasonable number of users.
- Verify that the design meets all specified feature requirements.
Technical Considerations:
- Choice of password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
- Session management strategy (e.g., tokens, server-side sessions).
- Database schema design for user and profile data.
- Ensuring data privacy and compliance (if applicable).
Estimated Completion Time: 10 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the authentication or session management design.
- Mitigation: Follow security best practices; conduct a security review of the design. Use well-tested libraries for authentication.
- Risk: Difficulty in isolating user data effectively while allowing shared knowledge access.
- Mitigation: Carefully design access control logic; implement thorough testing of data access rules.
