Task Title: Create Windows System Operation Manual
Description: Document desktop applications, common navigation patterns, and control strategies for the Windows Vision and Control system to enable autonomous operation. This manual will be used by the AI agent and potentially by developers.
Dependency Analysis: Task5.txt, Task6.txt
Implementation Steps:
1. Identify a set of common Windows applications to be documented (e.g., File Explorer, Notepad, Calculator, common web browsers).
2. For each application, document key UI elements, menu structures, and common tasks.
3. Define standard navigation patterns (e.g., opening files, saving files, closing applications).
4. Document control strategies for interacting with these applications using the developed vision and control tools.
5. Structure the manual in a way that is easy for the AI agent to parse and use (potentially a structured format like XML or JSON, or well-structured Markdown).
Acceptance Criteria:
- A manual documenting common Windows applications, navigation, and control strategies is created.
- The manual covers a predefined list of applications and tasks.
- The format is suitable for use by the AI agent.
Testing Requirements:
- Review the manual for accuracy and completeness.
- Test the documented strategies by attempting to automate tasks using the manual's guidance and the system's capabilities.
Technical Considerations:
- The manual needs to be easily updatable as new applications or features are supported.
- Consider using screenshots or diagrams to illustrate UI elements and navigation.
- The level of detail should be sufficient for the agent to make decisions.
Estimated Completion Time: 10 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Manual becomes outdated quickly with OS or application updates.
- Mitigation: Focus on fundamental patterns; design a process for updating the manual.
- Risk: Documentation is too abstract or too specific, hindering agent generalization.
- Mitigation: Provide a mix of general principles and concrete examples.
