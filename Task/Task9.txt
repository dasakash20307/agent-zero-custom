Task Title: Implement User Authentication and Profile Management Backend
Description: Develop the backend logic for user ID/password authentication, user registration (if applicable), profile creation/management, and chat session management.
Dependency Analysis: Task8.txt
Implementation Steps:
1. Implement user registration functionality (if required by design).
2. Implement the login mechanism, including password hashing and verification.
3. Develop functions for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting user profiles.
4. Implement session management (e.g., creating, validating, and expiring sessions).
5. Set up database tables or storage for user credentials and profiles.
6. Ensure secure storage of sensitive user data (especially passwords).
7. Develop API endpoints for authentication and profile management.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can register (if applicable) and log in with valid credentials.
- Incorrect login attempts are handled appropriately.
- User profiles can be created and managed through backend functions/APIs.
- Sessions are managed securely.
- All backend logic is unit-tested.
Testing Requirements:
- Test user registration and login with various valid and invalid inputs.
- Test profile CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Perform security testing on authentication endpoints (e.g., for brute-force attacks, SQL injection if applicable).
- Verify session persistence and expiration.
Technical Considerations:
- Integration with the chosen database system.
- API design for frontend interaction.
- Logging of authentication events for security auditing.
Estimated Completion Time: 14 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Flaws in password hashing or storage implementation.
- Mitigation: Use industry-standard libraries for password hashing; store only hashed passwords.
- Risk: Backend APIs are insecure or expose sensitive data.
- Mitigation: Implement proper input validation and output encoding; conduct API security testing.
