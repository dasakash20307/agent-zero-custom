Task Title: Define Human-Readable Tools/Instruments Guide Structure
Description: Outline the structure, sections, and key content areas for the human-readable Tools and Instruments guide. This guide is intended for developers and users to understand how to create and use tools/instruments within the AI agent system. It will be suitable for inclusion in the project's README.md.
Dependency Analysis: None
Implementation Steps:
1. Research best practices for technical documentation and README guides.
2. Identify key information categories needed for understanding tool creation (e.g., purpose, syntax, parameters, examples, troubleshooting).
3. Define a clear and logical heading structure for the guide.
4. Specify the tone and style suitable for a mixed audience (technical and less technical users).
5. Create a template or outline for the guide content.
Acceptance Criteria:
- A documented outline for the human-readable guide is produced.
- The outline includes all necessary sections for comprehensive understanding.
- The structure is logical and easy to navigate.
Testing Requirements:
- Review the outline with a team member for clarity and completeness.
- Compare the outline against examples of high-quality technical documentation.
Technical Considerations:
- The guide should be in Markdown format.
- Consider how this guide will integrate or link with the agent-readable version.
Estimated Completion Time: 4 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Outline may be too generic or miss crucial details.
- Mitigation: Solicit feedback early from potential users or developers of the tools.
- Risk: Overly complex structure.
- Mitigation: Prioritize simplicity and clarity; use examples to illustrate.
