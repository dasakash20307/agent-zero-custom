Task Title: Draft and Finalize Tools/Instruments Documentation (Both Versions)
Description: Write the full content for both the human-readable Tools and Instruments guide (based on Task 1's outline) and populate the agent-readable knowledge base (based on Task 2's schema) with initial tool examples.
Dependency Analysis: Task1.txt, Task2.txt
Implementation Steps:
1. Write the content for each section of the human-readable guide, following the approved outline from Task 1. Include examples and clear explanations.
2. Populate the agent-readable knowledge base with definitions for a few initial or example tools, adhering to the schema from Task 2.
3. Develop the user query instructions within the agent-readable knowledge base, ensuring they are actionable for the agent.
4. Review both documents for clarity, accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
5. Incorporate any feedback from reviews.
Acceptance Criteria:
- A complete draft of the human-readable Tools and Instruments guide is produced.
- The agent-readable knowledge base is populated with initial tool definitions and user query instructions.
- Both documents are reviewed and approved.
Testing Requirements:
- Human-readable guide: Proofread for grammar, spelling, and clarity. Have a developer unfamiliar with the tools attempt to understand them using the guide.
- Agent-readable knowledge base: Validate the populated data against the schema. Test the agent's ability to interpret the data (simulated if necessary).
Technical Considerations:
- Ensure consistent terminology between both versions where appropriate.
- Maintain version control for both documents.
Estimated Completion Time: 8 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Inconsistencies between the human-readable and agent-readable versions.
- Mitigation: Cross-reference both documents during creation and review.
- Risk: Content is not detailed enough or contains inaccuracies.
- Mitigation: Involve subject matter experts in the review process.
