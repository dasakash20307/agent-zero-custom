Task Title: Implement Core Windows Screen Casting and Desktop Management
Description: Develop the foundational components for screen casting (capturing the desktop image) and basic desktop management (e.g., getting screen resolution, listing open windows).
Dependency Analysis: Task4.txt
Implementation Steps:
1. Implement screen capture functionality to get real-time images of the Windows desktop.
2. Develop functions to retrieve basic desktop information (e.g., screen dimensions, number of monitors).
3. Implement functionality to list currently open windows and their titles.
4. Create a basic framework for managing different desktop sessions or states if needed.
5. Ensure efficient image capture with minimal performance impact.
Acceptance Criteria:
- The system can reliably capture screenshots of the Windows desktop.
- The system can retrieve and display current screen resolution and list of open windows.
- Core components are unit-tested.
Testing Requirements:
- Test screen capture on different display resolutions and multi-monitor setups.
- Verify the accuracy of window listing.
- Measure performance impact of screen casting.
Technical Considerations:
- Choice of screen capture method (e.g., BitBlt, Desktop Duplication API).
- Handling of different display scaling settings in Windows.
Estimated Completion Time: 10 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Screen capture is slow or resource-intensive.
- Mitigation: Optimize capture methods; explore hardware acceleration if available. Test different libraries.
- Risk: Incompatibility with certain graphics drivers or Windows versions.
- Mitigation: Test on various target environments; provide clear compatibility notes.
