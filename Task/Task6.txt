Task Title: Implement Application Launching and Automated Task Control
Description: Build the functionality for launching specified applications and automating tasks through visual recognition (e.g., finding and clicking UI elements) and simulated input (mouse clicks, keyboard entries).
Dependency Analysis: Task5.txt
Implementation Steps:
1. Develop functions to launch applications by name or path.
2. Implement basic visual recognition to locate UI elements on the screen using template matching or feature detection (e.g., finding a button by its image).
3. Create functions to simulate mouse movements, clicks (left, right, double), and keyboard input.
4. Integrate visual recognition with input simulation to perform simple automated tasks (e.g., "click the 'File' menu, then 'Open'").
5. Design a way to define and execute simple automation scripts.
Acceptance Criteria:
- The system can launch specified Windows applications.
- The system can locate predefined UI elements on the screen based on image templates.
- The system can simulate mouse clicks and keyboard input at specified coordinates or on found elements.
- Simple automated sequences can be executed successfully.
Testing Requirements:
- Test application launching for various common applications.
- Test UI element detection with different themes and resolutions.
- Verify the accuracy of mouse and keyboard simulation.
- Test a few simple automation scripts (e.g., opening Notepad and typing text).
Technical Considerations:
- Robustness of visual recognition against minor UI changes.
- Handling of dynamic UI elements and changing window positions.
- Ensuring input simulation is not blocked by security software.
- Use of OCR for text recognition on UI elements.
Estimated Completion Time: 16 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Visual recognition is unreliable due to UI variations.
- Mitigation: Explore more advanced image recognition techniques; allow for configurable sensitivity. Use relative positioning where possible.
- Risk: Simulated input is intercepted or behaves unexpectedly.
- Mitigation: Test with common security settings; investigate different input injection methods.
