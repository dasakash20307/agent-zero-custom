Task Title: Develop Agent-Readable Tools/Instruments Knowledge Base Structure
Description: Design the structure and content for the agent-readable knowledge base for tool creation. This knowledge base will serve as a direct input for the AI agent to understand how to build and use tools. It must include specific instructions for how the agent should query users to gather requirements for new tools.
Dependency Analysis: None
Implementation Steps:
1. Determine the optimal format for the agent's knowledge base (e.g., structured text, JSON, XML). - COMPLETED
   - Note: Chosen format: Markdown with YAML front matter for tool definitions, embedded within a structured Markdown document for the overall KB.
2. Define fields and attributes necessary for the agent to understand tool specifications (e.g., tool name, description, parameters, input/output format, dependencies, execution commands). - COMPLETED
   - Note: Completed. Schema defined in Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md Section 2, covering core attributes, inputs, outputs, dependencies, execution details, and configuration.
3. Develop a clear schema for representing tool capabilities and configurations. - COMPLETED
   - Note: Completed. See Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md Section 2.
4. Create specific instructions and question templates for the agent to use when querying users about new tool requirements (e.g., "What is the primary function of this tool?", "What inputs does this tool require?", "What output should this tool produce?"). - COMPLETED
   - Note: Completed. See Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md Section 4 for User Query Templates and Interaction Patterns.
5. Document the process for updating and maintaining this knowledge base. - COMPLETED
   - Note: Completed. See Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md Section 9 for Extensibility Guidelines, including version control.
Acceptance Criteria:
- A defined schema for the agent-readable knowledge base is created. - ACHIEVED. Schema is in Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md, Section 2.
- The schema includes all necessary fields for tool definition and agent understanding. - ACHIEVED. Comprehensive fields defined.
- A set of user query templates for requirement gathering is developed. - ACHIEVED. Templates are in Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md, Section 4.
Testing Requirements:
- Validate the schema with example tool definitions. - DONE. Example templates in Section 3 of Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md serve as initial validation.
- Test the user query templates for clarity and effectiveness in gathering necessary information. - Conceptualized in Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md Section 4. Practical testing would be part of agent implementation.
- Simulate agent parsing of the knowledge base format. - Format (Markdown + YAML) is standard and parsable. Actual agent parsing logic is part of agent implementation.
Technical Considerations:
- The format must be easily parsable by the AI agent.
- Consider versioning for the knowledge base schema. (Addressed in Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md Section 2.7 and 9.1)
- Ensure query templates are designed to elicit precise and actionable information.
Estimated Completion Time: 6 hours (Initial design and documentation phase completed)
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Knowledge base format is too complex for the agent to parse reliably.
- Mitigation: Start with a simple, well-defined format and iterate. Perform parsing tests early. (Mitigated by choosing Markdown + YAML)
- Risk: User query templates are ambiguous or lead to incomplete information.
- Mitigation: Test queries with sample user personas; refine based on feedback. (Conceptual templates provided for future testing)
Progress Update:
The primary deliverable for this task, `Agent_Tools_Knowledge_Base.md`, has been created and populated with a comprehensive structure. This includes:
- Section 1: Introduction
- Section 2: Detailed Knowledge Base Schema Definition
- Section 3: Tool Definition Templates (CLI, API, Script-based)
- Section 4: User Query Templates & Interaction Patterns
- Section 5: Decision Trees & Logic Flows for Tool Handling
- Section 6: Validation and Testing Frameworks
- Section 7: Error Handling and Troubleshooting Automation
- Section 8: Integration Patterns
- Section 9: Extensibility Guidelines
- Section 10: Appendix (Optional placeholder)
This document fulfills the requirements of defining the knowledge base structure and content for agent-based tool creation and interaction.
