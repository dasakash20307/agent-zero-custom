Task Title: Develop Agent-Readable Tools/Instruments Knowledge Base Structure
Description: Design the structure and content for the agent-readable knowledge base for tool creation. This knowledge base will serve as a direct input for the AI agent to understand how to build and use tools. It must include specific instructions for how the agent should query users to gather requirements for new tools.
Dependency Analysis: None
Implementation Steps:
1. Determine the optimal format for the agent's knowledge base (e.g., structured text, JSON, XML).
2. Define fields and attributes necessary for the agent to understand tool specifications (e.g., tool name, description, parameters, input/output format, dependencies, execution commands).
3. Develop a clear schema for representing tool capabilities and configurations.
4. Create specific instructions and question templates for the agent to use when querying users about new tool requirements (e.g., "What is the primary function of this tool?", "What inputs does this tool require?", "What output should this tool produce?").
5. Document the process for updating and maintaining this knowledge base.
Acceptance Criteria:
- A defined schema for the agent-readable knowledge base is created.
- The schema includes all necessary fields for tool definition and agent understanding.
- A set of user query templates for requirement gathering is developed.
Testing Requirements:
- Validate the schema with example tool definitions.
- Test the user query templates for clarity and effectiveness in gathering necessary information.
- Simulate agent parsing of the knowledge base format.
Technical Considerations:
- The format must be easily parsable by the AI agent.
- Consider versioning for the knowledge base schema.
- Ensure query templates are designed to elicit precise and actionable information.
Estimated Completion Time: 6 hours
Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Knowledge base format is too complex for the agent to parse reliably.
- Mitigation: Start with a simple, well-defined format and iterate. Perform parsing tests early.
- Risk: User query templates are ambiguous or lead to incomplete information.
- Mitigation: Test queries with sample user personas; refine based on feedback.
