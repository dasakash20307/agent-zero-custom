# Project Update Requirement Document (PURD)

## 1. Introduction
Brief overview of the project and the purpose of this document.

## 2. Project Scope
Details on the overall goals of the repository enhancement project.

## 3. Feature Analysis and Prioritization

### 3.1. Feature 1: Tools and Instruments Documentation
    - Description: Develop comprehensive documentation for creating and enabling tools and instruments for AI agents. This requires creating two distinct versions: a human-readable format suitable for inclusion in the README.md file, and an agent-readable format that serves as a knowledge base for tool creation. The agent-readable version should include specific instructions for querying users about tool requirements to ensure complete understanding of implementation goals.
    - Tasks: 1, 2, 3
    - Priority: High

### 3.2. Feature 2: Windows Vision and Control System
    - Description: Design and implement a sophisticated Windows 11 integration system that provides intelligent desktop access and control capabilities. This system should enable screen casting, desktop management, application launching, and automated task completion through visual recognition and control mechanisms. Include provisions for creating a comprehensive Windows manual that documents desktop applications, navigation patterns, and control strategies for autonomous operation.
    - Tasks: 4, 5, 6, 7
    - Priority: High

### 3.3. Feature 3: Multi-User Authentication and Profile Management
    - Description: Implement a robust login system featuring User ID and password authentication with individual user profiles and separated chat sessions. Maintain shared knowledge bases and context while ensuring proper user isolation. Design the system to preserve the existing main chat window functionality while adding a dedicated multi-user chat section with appropriate permission controls. Implement separate tunnel configurations for regular users with persistent, custom domain integration while maintaining administrative control through the main panel.
    - Tasks: 8, 9, 10
    - Priority: Medium
